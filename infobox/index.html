                            <h3>Protection measures for everyone</h3>
                            <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.</p>
                            <p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</li>
                              <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.</li>
                              <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.</li>
                              <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</li>
                              <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.</li>
                              <li>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places &nbsp;– especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease. Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.</li>

If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.

                            <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</p>
                            <p>COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html" target="_blank">many affected geographic areas</a>. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.</p>

If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains 60% alcohol. Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects daily using a regular household detergent and water.</li>
                            <li><strong>Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular work schedule changes.</strong> Ask to work from home or take leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/symptoms.html" target="_blank">COVID-19 symptoms</a>, or if your child’s school is dismissed temporarily. <a href="https://www.cdc.govhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-business-response.html" target="_blank">Learn how businesses and employers can plan for and respond to COVID-19.</a></li>

                            <p>Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
                            <p>However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/index.html" target="_blank">healthy habits</a> around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.
